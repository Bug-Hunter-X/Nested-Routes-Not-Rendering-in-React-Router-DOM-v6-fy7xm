This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with nested routes in React Router DOM v6. The problem is that nested routes, despite their parent route rendering, fail to render their respective components.  The solution provided addresses the problem by clarifying route definitions and demonstrating how to correctly nest routes to achieve desired rendering behavior.
